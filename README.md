## Description

The intent of this course is to provide an introduction of Quarto for intermediate to advanced R users that are seeking to develop automated reports. We will present on the basics of Quarto. After an introduction, we will walk through demonstrations in which participants will use an example dataset to create a Quarto report by rendering to a Word, PDF, and HTML documents. It is our hope that participants will leave with the foundational skills required to create a Quarto report.

The learning goals are to:

- Introduction to Quarto and itâ€™s applications.
- Example reports using different rendering outputs.
-	Create your own report participant exercise.
-	Discussion session to address questions or report ideas of participants.

## Audience

Learners with experience using R who are curious to learn how to author Quarto documents.
