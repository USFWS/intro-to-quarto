All of the birds this year were adjacent to the restoration area to the south, whereas in the past two years the birds were near the northern park boundary.  This may be due to the large tides washing up much of the beach in the north and creating a sharp cut bank rather than a smooth slope or extended beach and wrack line like usual.

I did not make it all the way to the south jetty this year as the tide was coming in and running up the beach pretty high.  I do not believe I would have missed many birds as the beach gets steeper and much narrower with a lot of large wood and high bank the further south you go.

","At Sitka, From spit opening south to beach access 34A, dune is now a 6-10 foot sand wall. Estuary mouth is moving south, all dunes at spit opening are now gone and only a small portion of one remains. No signage was seen in area. I counted 4 cars driving erratically around in the SPMA. Did not find any plovers at sitka, only found one track. 

At Sandlake, all plovers were in 5 loose groups, either foraging or roosting. Conditions were partly sunny, 58, and no wind. Significant acreage of suitable habitat has been added to the southern end of the fishermen's day use/ pedestrian only beach area. A lot of seaweed and detritus on sand. Conditions seem good for breeding habitat, flat, out of high tide zone, with a free-flowing structure. I encountered 5 people in area. In summer visitor use is much heavier.

1. Suspected Plover tracks observed (45.510672, -123.956483). Eleanor Gaines suspects they are plover tracks. Dave Lauten can't tell and says they could be plover or Western/Least Sanderling. two photos were taken of the tracks.

2. Bald eagle (HALE) observed flying overhead (45.526926, -123.953321)

General: Lots of families and dogs at the beach and the tide was on it's way out. Observed possible plover tracks along the way, but no birds were seen. It seems like the North end of the spit could have better plover habitat since there are less people up there.
