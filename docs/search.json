We will then dive into the anatomy of a Quarto file, which can be broken into three primary components: the YAML metadata, the document body, and code blocks (or code “chunks”).\nThe workshop is a series of short presentations followed by hand-on exercises to practice what you’ve learned.\nWe will be available to provide help during the exercises, so let us know by raising your hand (in person or virtually!)"

Therefore, if you are working on reports that contain text, plots, tables and statistical results, you should consider using Quarto. [click]\nWith Quarto, you can easily update output when the data are updated.Therefore, if you find yourself recreating annual reports, then Quarto could improve your efficiency. [click]\nSimilarly, if you need to reproduce an analysis, Quarto would be your friend.

    "text": "Exercise 1: Rendering\nRendering in Quarto documents refers to the process of converting a Quarto file, which is written in a markdown-like syntax, into a final output format such as HTML, PDF, or Word. During rendering, the Quarto system interprets the markdown content, processes embedded R code chunks, and generates the respective output by applying formatting specified in the YAML header. This transformation allows users to produce well-structured and visually appealing documents that incorporate text, data visualizations, and analysis results seamlessly, making it an essential step in creating dynamic reports and presentations.\n\nTasks\n\nOpen 1_rendering.qmd. What are three main components of the file?\nRender the document using the RStudio GUI (  ).\nRender the document using the Quarto CLI.\n\n\n\nHint\n\nIn the terminal: quarto render 1_rendering\\&lt;input file name&gt;\n\n\nRender the document using the quarto R package.\n\n\n\nHint\n\nIn the console: quarto::quarto_render(\"./1_rendering/&lt;input file name&gt;\")",

    "text": "Exercise 2: YAML metadata\nA YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) header is a crucial component of Quarto documents that defines metadata for the document, typically enclosed within a pair of triple-dashed lines at the beginning of the file.

Additionally, YAML headers can include parameters to control formatting options and customize the behavior of the document, such as including bibliographies or setting specific themes. By using a YAML header, authors can ensure that their documents are well-organized and professionally presented.\n\nTasks\n\nOpen 2_yaml_metadata.qmd and render the document.\nUpdate the subtitle and replace the author name with your name.

This section is typically written in markdown format, allowing users to easily incorporate various elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and images. The importance of the document body lies in its role as the primary medium for communicating information and insights to the reader; it organizes thoughts and results in a coherent and engaging manner. A well-structured document body enhances readability and comprehension, enabling the audience to grasp complex ideas and data more effectively. By integrating both text and visual elements, the document body plays a critical role in making the overall document informative and visually appealing.\n\nTasks\nOpen 3-document_body.qmd and make the following changes to the document:\nInline:\n\nItalicize the species name.\nMake “western snowy plover” a hyperlink to the FWS page or Wikipedia page for western snowy plover.\n\nBlock:\n\nCreate a new header named “My List”.\nMake an ordered and unordered list.\nInsert an image of the western snow plover below the “U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service” header.

These chunks are enclosed by specific delimiters, enabling Quarto to recognize and execute the code during the rendering process. The importance of code chunks lies in their ability to integrate dynamic content with narrative text, making it possible to showcase real-time analysis and results alongside explanatory writing. This functionality enhances reproducibility, as the document can simultaneously present the code and its output, facilitating transparency and allowing others to verify or replicate the findings. By incorporating code chunks, Quarto documents become interactive and informative, transforming static reports into live analytical narratives.\n\nTasks\nOpen 4_code_chunks.qmd and make the following changes to the rendered document:\n\nLabel the plot code chunk to help you differentiate from other chunks.\nUpdate the figure caption to read “Mean monthly Western…”\nAdd + theme_classic() to end of ggplot script to clean up plot.

After you open a Quarto file, you will see a button on the top menu call “render”.\nAnother approach is render directly to the Quarto program using the command line interface. To do this, click on the “Terminal” menu in RStudio and type “quarto render”. You can type “quarto preview”, which will both render the document and open a preview window to view the output.\nThe 3rd approach is to render a Quarto document using the Quarto R package. To do this, install and load the Quarto R package in RStudio. In the console, type (quarto_render(some arguments…))."

It is traditional approach to editing documents and most used by those familiar with Quarto.\n\nThe Visual editor shows changes in real time and previews what the document looks like without re-rendering it. It also provides a menu with buttons for things like support for inserting tables, figures, and citations; and formatting fonts and headers. It provides an easier interface for those learning Quarto who are familiar with word processing software like Word."
