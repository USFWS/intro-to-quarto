## Outline

1. Overview of Quarto (25 mins)
2. YAML metadata (20 min)  
  
BREAK (10 min)

3. Document body (25 min)
4. Code blocks (25 min)  
  
BREAK (10 min)

5. Final exercise and wrap-up (20 min)

::: {.notes}
- This workshop serves as an introduction to using Quarto to create reports.
- During our time here, we will provide a brief overview of what Quarto is, what it can do for you, and how it compares to R Markdown. We will then dive into the anatomy of a Quarto file, which can be broken into three primary components: the YAML metadata, the document body, and code blocks (or code "chunks").
- The workshop is a series of short presentations followed by hand-on exercises to practice what you've learned.
- We will be available to provide help during the exercises, so let us know by raising your hand (in person or virtually!)

::: {.notes}
- Ok, let's dive into the world of creating documents using Quarto.
- Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.
- Allows you to analyze data, weave together code output with text, and publish your story in multiple formats.
- What can you do with Quarto?
    - Generate dynamic output using R. Python, and other languages that can be regenerated when the data change.
    - Has support for equations and citations.
    - Integrates well into RStudio and other code editors
    - Can create interactive documents by embedding html widgets and Shiny.
- It solves the problem of moving between multiple software during your data workflow.
- It's quite powerful!
:::


## Outputs: [Documents]{.gray-bold}

::: {.center}
{{< pdf images/example_report.pdf width=75% height=775 >}}
:::

::: {.notes}
- Quarto can produce high quality documents in HTML, PDF or MS Word.
- Has the ability to output content using standardized templates, as shown here for a refuge report.
:::


## Output: [Websites]{.gray-bold}

```{=html}
<iframe width="1600" height="800" src="https://usfws.github.io/Science_Applications_Metadata_Guidance/" title="USFWS Science Applications Metadata Guidance"></iframe>
```

::: {.notes}
- Quarto can also create websites, such as this Science Applications Metadata Guidance.
- The course website that we are using today was created in Quarto.
:::


## Outputs: [Presentations]{.gray-bold}

```{=html}
<iframe width="1600" height="800" src="https://usfws.github.io/data-workflow-presentation/#/a-reproducible-data-workflow/" title="Presentation slides from a Reproducible Data Workflow presentation"></iframe>
```

::: {.notes}
- Quarto can also output professional-looking presentations as HTML-based Revealjs presentations or as PowerPoint. Templates are available online or with a little CSS code, you can create your own.
:::


## Outputs: [Books]{.gray-bold}

```{=html}
<iframe width="1600" height="800" src="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/" title="R for Data Science ebook"></iframe>
```

::: {.notes}
Finally, it's possible to write books using Quarto, such as the R for Data Science book shown here.

- To summarize, Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.
- Instead of writing a report or presentation in Word, PowerPoint, etc.; then running code in an R script; then saving output and visualizations; and then pasting them in the report or the presentation
- We can do it all in Quarto, a free system especially tailored to scientific and technical publishing.

## Quarto and R Markdown

:::{.fragment}
![](images/render1.png){height=800 fig-alt="A diagram showing the process of rendering a document using R Markdown."}
:::

::: {.notes}
- How does it work and how does it compare with R Markdown? 
- If you are familiar with R Markdown, you might be familiar with the two step rendering process.
- With R Markdown, you start out with an R Markdown document, which includes text and R code.
:::


## Quarto and R Markdown

![](images/render2.png){height=800 fig-alt="A diagram showing the process of rendering a document using R Markdown."}  

::: {.notes}
- When you knit an R Markdown file, an R package "knitr" calls the engine knitr to execute your R code, and create an Markdown file that include the original text and the output of your code. 
:::

## Quarto and R Markdown

![](images/render3.png){height=800 fig-alt="A diagram showing the process of rendering a document using R Markdown."}  

::: {.notes}
- In the final step, R Markdown calls on Pandoc, a universal document converter, to produce whatever output you’ve specified.
:::


## Quarto and R Markdown

:::{.fragment}
![](images/render4.png){height=800 fig-alt="A diagram showing the process of rendering a document using Quarto."}  
:::

::: {.notes}
- The process for rendering a Quarto document is similar to R Markdown, with a notable change. A Quarto .qmd file on the other hand can be composed of text and R, Python, and/or Julia code. 
:::


## Quarto and R Markdown

![](images/render5.png){height=800 fig-alt="A diagram showing the process of rendering a document using Quarto."}  

::: {.notes}
- Depending on the code language in the document, Quarto will then assign either the knitr or jupyter engine to render your text and code into a Markdown file followed by Pandoc producing whatever output you’ve specified.
Quarto accomplishes this by being fully separated from the R ecosystem. You can even run it from the command-line interface (i.e., the shell or terminal), if you want to. 
:::


## Quarto and R Markdown

![](images/render6.png){height=800 fig-alt="A diagram showing the process of rendering a document using Quarto."}  

::: {.notes}

- Embedding code and output from Python, R, and JavaScript via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable.

- A variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.

- A project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like websites and books.

- Authoring using a wide variety of editors and notebooks including JupyterLab, RStudio, and VS Code.

- A visual markdown editor that provides a productive writing interface for composing long-form documents.

## When to use Quarto and R Markdown? 

::: columns

::: {.column width="40%"}

\

::: {.incremental}
- Weave together text, plots, tables, and statistics
- Frequently re-create a standardized document
- Reproduce your analyses
- Generate comparable reports across multiple parameters (species, watershed, state)
:::

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/plover_thinking.png){height=800 fig-alt="An cartoon of a snowy plover thinking. There is a question mark above it's head."}
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
- Now we know what Quarto is and what it can do for us, you might be wondering, when should I use Quarto and when should I stick with my current approach?
[click]
- As I mentioned, Quarto is able to seamlessly weave together text and code output. Therefore, if you are working on reports that contain text, plots, tables and statistical results, you should consider using Quarto.
[click]
- With Quarto, you can easily update output when the data are updated.Therefore, if you find yourself recreating annual reports, then Quarto could improve your efficiency.
[click]
- Similarly, if you need to reproduce an analysis, Quarto would be your friend.
[click]
- Finally, you might be in a situation when you need to regenerate a standardize report for different species or across different regions. The layout and analysis are unchanged, but the data input do change. Quarto can do this by specifying what's called "parameters".

::: {.notes}
If you are coming as an R Markdown user, you're at a crossroads! How do you decide whether to move from R Markdown to Quarto? I'll touch on some of the advantages of each system.
:::

## Advantages of R Markdown

::: columns

::: {.column width="40%" .incremental}
\

- Have existing R Markdown code that works for you
- Custom tools built around R Markdown that are not yet available in Quarto
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![](images/rmarkdown_packages.png){fig-align=center height=750 .drop}
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
- If you like using R Markdown, there’s no need to switch! R Markdown will continue to be supported and work as it always has been. You’re welcome to try Quarto if you like, but there’s no need to switch. 
[click]
- If you have a R Markdown file that includes custom tools, there is a chance that they might not yet in available in Quarto. If this is the case, you're of course welcome to stick with R Markdown. As they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
:::


## Advantages of Quarto

::: columns

::: {.column width="60%"}

:::{.incremental}
- No requirement for R
- Fewer package dependencies
- Revealjs slides are easier to work with
- Better cross referencing of figures, tables, and citations
- Quarto [extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/){target="_blank"} allow for easier customization
- Quarto projects make it easier to customize websites, create books, and collaborate
- It's the future! {{< fa rocket >}}
:::

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](images/quarto.png){.drop}
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
- That said, there are a number of advantage to using Quarto, including:
  - No requirement for R (multilingual)
    - R, Python, Julia, Javascript
  - More streamline and less R package dependencies
    - Use revealjs directly for pretty slides, rather than relying on host of R packages.
  - Cross referencing figures and tables in the text is more straightforward, as is inserting and managing citations.
  - A growing number of Quarto extensions add functionality
    - Allow you use customized templates and 
  - Quarto projects
    - Easier to create websites, books, collaborate on projects, etc.
  - Most active development has moved from R Markdown to Quarto. It will only get better with time.

## Three ways to render Quarto documents

\

::: columns

::: {.column width="32%" .center}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
### 1.  
**RStudio GUI**
![](images/quarto_render1.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a Quarto document in RStudio. The Render button is circled in red" .drop}

![](images/render_icon.png){width=200 .drop fig-alt="The render icon in RStudio."}
:::
:::

::: {.column width="32%" .center}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
### 2.   
**Quarto command line interface (CLI)**
![](images/quarto_render2.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of the command line terminal in RStudio. quarto render is typed in." .drop}
:::
:::

::: {.column width="36%" .center}
::: {.fragment fragment-index=3}
### 3. 
**Quarto R package**

::: {.small}
```r
quarto::quarto_render(input = ___, 
                      output_format = ___)
```
:::

:::
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
- Creating output from a Quarto document is called "rendering".
- It is something that you will do repeatedly to view updates to a Quarto file, and make sure that everything is running properly.
- Therefore, it's worth noting now that there are 3 different approaches to rendering a Quarto file.
1. The first and most common method is through the Rstudio application interface. After you open a Quarto file, you will see a button on the top menu call "render".
2. Another approach is render directly to the Quarto program using the command line interface. To do this, click on the "Terminal" menu in RStudio and type "quarto render". You can type "quarto preview", which will both render the document and open a preview window to view the output.
3. The 3rd approach is to render a Quarto document using the Quarto R package. To do this, install and load the Quarto R package in RStudio. In the console, type (quarto_render(some arguments...)).

::: {.column width="50%" .center}

### Source editor

![](images/source_pane.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a Quarto document in RStudio viewed as Source." .drop}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .center}

### Visual editor

![](images/visual_pane.png){fig-alt="A screenshot of a Quarto document in RStudio viewed as Visual." .drop}
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
- For our purposes, we will be using RStudio to edit Quarto documents. Within RStudio, there are two editors available to make changes to Quarto documents: the Source editor and the Visual editor. 
- The source editor displays the raw Quarto document. It is traditional approach to editing documents and most used by those familiar with Quarto.  
- The Visual editor shows changes in real time and previews what the document looks like without re-rendering it. It also provides a menu with buttons for things like support for inserting tables, figures, and citations; and formatting fonts and headers. It provides an easier interface for those learning Quarto who are familiar with word processing software like Word.

# Anatomy of a Quarto File {.dark}

::: {.notes}
- In the last section, I introduced Quarto as an approach to creating dynamic documents that combine code and text. I outlined the process for rendering a Quarto document and discussed how that compares to R Markdown. I showed 3 approaches for rendering a Quarto document and two options for editing a Quarto document. 
- We will now move on to describing the component that make up all Quarto documents.
:::


## ![](images/quarto_example1.png)

::: {.notes}
- Here's an example of a Quarto document. It shows 3 basic components of Quarto documents: metadata (YAML header), the document body, and code. In the next 3 presentations, we will cover how each of these components come together to create a Quarto document.
:::


## YAML

**Y**et **A**nother **M**arkup **L**anguage = document metadata!

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{yml}
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: FALSE

---
title: "Introduction to Quarto"
author: "FWS staff"
format: 
  revealjs:
    theme: [default, refuge_light.scss]
editor: source
---
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .small .incremental}
- Starts and ends with "\-\-\-"
- Uses key-value pairs: `key: value` that can nest
- *Picky about spacing and indentations!*
- Processed during rendering
- Including options for:
  - Title, authors, date
  - File output(s) (e.g., `html`, `docx`)
  - Styling (e.g., `theme`, `fig-width`)
  - Parameters
   - And more...
:::

:::


::: {.notes}
- The YAML provides document level metadata. 
- It is a language that follows a standard syntax.
    - 
:::


## YAML metadata: [Options]{.gray-bold} 

::: {.incremental}
- Options are dependent on the file output (**many** options {{< fa face-flushed >}})  
- Search the [Quarto guidance](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/) within your specified file format:

::: {.fragment}
```{=html}
<iframe width="1600" height="600" src="https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/docx.html" title="Quarto HTML Options guidance"></iframe>
```
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
- The options available in the YAML are dependent on the file format that you select.
- There are a **ton** of options!
- To give you an idea, here's the Quarto guidance that shows YAML options for a Quarto document rendered to MS Word.
:::


## YAML metadata: [Options]{.gray-bold}

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Another option: Use your friendly assistant!
- Start a word and hit <kbd>`tab`</kbd> to complete or ...
- Type <kbd>`Ctrl+space`</kbd> to see available options.

- Markdown is a markup language (e.g., HTML, teX, XML)
  - Add syntax to the text to change it's look
  - Mix text with markup instructions
- Quarto uses Pandoc Markdown
    - Inline or block elements
:::

## Execution options: [Outputs]{.gray-bold}

::: {.small}
| Option    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `eval`    | Evaluate the code chunk (if `false`, just echos the code into the output).                                                                                                                        |
| `echo`    | Include the source code in output                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `output`  | Include the results of executing the code in the output (`true`, `false`, or `asis` to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto's standard enclosing markdown).  |
| `warning` | Include warnings in the output.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `error`   | Include errors in the output.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `include` | Catch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. `include: false` suppresses all output from the code block).                                                  |

- Quarto is a powerful tool for creating scientific documents, presentations, and websites.
- Three basic components of a Quarto file control the rendered output:
    - YAML metadata
    - Text body
    - Code chunks
- Once you understand the basics,  the sky's the limit!
