This workshop provides an introduction to Quarto for intermediate to advanced R users. We present on the basics of using Quarto to generate dynamic reports. After an introduction, we use an example dataset to render a Quarto report to Word, PDF, and HTML documents. Participants will leave with the foundational skills required to create a Quarto report.
